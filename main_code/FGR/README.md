# The functional group rerpresentation module.

I have taken the liberty of taking only the necessary components of the original project.
The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/roshanmsb/fgmolprop) (The repo might be private).

For my project I will use the pretrained encoder to and train everything (the encoder, the phenotype prediction module) in a single go.

I will use [this](load_FGR.py) file to import the Encoder module and to preprocess data.

Cheers :v:
